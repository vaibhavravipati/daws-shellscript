A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena
physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior
Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations
however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical
